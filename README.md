# LeNet
Implement LeNet on MNIST using TensorFlow.

## Installation
Pip all needed packages using requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
You can use to run model:
```bash
python LeNet.py
```
This will run training and testing with default parameters (without any parameters tuning from terminal). In the future, we'll update the model to pass arguments from terminal.

Default max training epochs is equal to 10.
